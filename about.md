# Let's solve a hard problem together

I’m a *User Experience Professional* in the Greater Boston area. I work with clients to devise and implement 
their digital marketing strategies, based on sound UX research, business strategy, and the latest web 
technologies.

I started creating websites in 
[1994](https://web.archive.org/web/19990117063013/http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~joker/home.html) — commercially 
in [1996](https://web.archive.org/web/19961111204026/http://www.nees.com/) — and I've never looked back. My 
experience spans *cybersecurity, tech, non-profit, B2B, and consumer* spaces.

When [NCSA Mosaic](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic) got inline JPEG support in v2, it was a _big deal_. Since then, the web has evolved 
incredibly. We can now create amazingly rich user experiences.

Today, I provide *unbiased user experience expertise* for my clients, focused on getting *real digital 
marketing results*, while remaining deeply informed by my *technical foundation and design education*. My UX 
consulting engagements with B2C & B2B organizations have dramatically increased customer sign-ups, MQL lead 
generation, and product sales.

My projects have won dozens of [awards](https://www.imarc.com/awards) for clients including JetBlue, SecurityScorecard, RSA Security, 
Rapid7, SSH, Digital Guardian, Press Ganey, Atlantic Broadband, Barnes & Noble, Motorola and Texas 
Instruments.

*If you have a hard problem, let's tackle it together.*
